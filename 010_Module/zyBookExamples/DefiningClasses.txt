10.5 Defining a class
Private data members
In addition to public member functions, a class definition has private data members: variables that member functions can access but class users cannot. Private data members appear after the word "private:" in a class definition.

10.5.1: Private data members.

class Restaurant {                          // Keeps a user's review of a restaurant
   public:                                    
      void SetName(string restaurantName);  // Sets the restaurant's name        
      void SetRating(int userRating);       // Sets the rating (1-5, with 5 best)    
      void Print();                         // Prints name and rating on one line 
   private:
      string name;
      int rating;
};

int main() {
   Restaurant favLunchPlace;

   favLunchPlace.rating = 5; // ERROR A class user cannot access a class' private data members; only the class' member functions can
   ...
}

Defining a class' public member functions
A programmer defining a class first declares member functions after the word "public:" in the class definition. A function declaration provides the function's name, return type, and parameter types, but not the function's statements.

The programmer must also define each member function. A function definition provides a class name, return type, parameter names and types, and the function's statements. A member function definition has the class name and two colons (::), known as the scope resolution operator, preceding the function's name. A member function definition can access private data members.
