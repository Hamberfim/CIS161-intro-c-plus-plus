The programmer uses a struct to define and use a new type as follows.

struct StructTypeName {
   type item1;
   type item2;
   ...
   type itemN;      
};

...
StructTypeName myVar;
 
myVar.item1 = ...


Each type may be any type like int or char. Each struct subitem is called a data member. For a declared variable, each struct data member can be accessed using ".", known as a member access operator, sometimes called dot notation.
