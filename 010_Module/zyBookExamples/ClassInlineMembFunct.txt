/* Exception to variables being declared before used
Normally, items like variables must be declared before being used, but this rule does not apply within a class definition. Ex: Above, SetRating() accesses rating, even though rating is declared a few lines after. This rule exception allows a class to have the desired form of a public region at the top and a private region at the bottom: A public inline member function can thus access a private data member even though that private data member is declared after the function. */
