/* Name: Overloading Functions
 * Author: Anthony Hamlin
 * CIS161 - 20447
 * Description:
 * This program computes and displays the charges for a patientâ€™s hospital stay. 
 * Instructions:
 * First, the program should ask if the patient was admitted as an inpatient or an outpatient.
 * If the patient was an inpatient, the following data should be entered:
 *      The number of days spent in the hospital
 *      The daily rate
 *      Hospital medication charges  {
 *      Charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
 *      
 * The program should ask for the following data if the patient was an outpatient:
 *      Charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
 *      Hospital medication charges
 *      
 *The program must use two overloaded functions (functions that have the same name but different parameters) to calculate the total charges.
 *One of the functions should accept arguments for the inpatient data, while the other function accepts arguments for outpatient information. 
 *Both functions should return the total charges.
