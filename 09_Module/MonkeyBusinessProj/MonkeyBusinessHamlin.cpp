 * Description:
 * A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three
 * monkeys eats each day during a typical week. Write a program that stores this
 * information in a two-dimensional 3 Ã— 5 array, where each row represents a
 * different monkey, and each column represents a different day of the week.
 *
 *  -----------------------
 *  |[0][0]||[0][1]|[0][2]|
 *  -----------------------
 *  |[1][0]||[1][1]|[1][2]|
 *  -----------------------
 *  |[2][0]||[2][1]|[2][2]|
 *  -----------------------
 *  |[3][0]||[3][1]|[3][2]|
 *  -----------------------
 *  |[4][0]||[4][1]|[4][2]|
 *  -----------------------
 *
 * The program should first have the user input the data for each monkey.
 * Then, it should create a report that includes the following information:
 *
 *      Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys.
 *      The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.
 *      The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.
 *
 * Write functions:
 *      average()
 *      least()
 *      greatest()
 *      main()
