/* 14.2 Exceptions with functions
The power of exceptions becomes clearer when used within a function. If an exception is thrown within a function and not caught within that function, then the function is immediately exited and the calling function is checked for a handler, and so on up the function call hierarchy. The following illustrates; note the clarity of the normal code.

Figure 14.2.1: BMI example using exception-handling constructs along with functions.  

Suppose getWeight() throws an exception of type Exception. GetWeight() immediately exits, up to main() where the call was in a try block, so the catch block catches the exception.

Note the clarity of the code in main(). Without exceptions, GetWeight() would have had to somehow indicate failure, perhaps returning -1. Then main() would have needed an if-else statement to detect such failure, obscuring the normal code.

If no handler is found going up the call hierarchy, then terminate() is called, which typically aborts the program.

In C++, when an exception is thrown, the function in which it was thrown (in this case, GetWeight()) immediately exits. The program then starts to look for the nearest catch block that can handle the exception type, going up the call stack.

In your code, the catch block in the main() function will catch the exception thrown by GetWeight(). This is because the call to GetWeight() is inside a try block in main().

Without exceptions, you would indeed need to use some other way to indicate an error, such as returning a special value like -1 from GetWeight(). Then, in main(), you would need to check the return value of GetWeight() and handle the error case separately, which can make the code more complex and harder to read.

If an exception is thrown and no suitable catch block is found in the entire call stack, then the function std::terminate() is called, which by default aborts the program. This is why itâ€™s important to have a catch block to handle any exceptions that might be thrown.

/* 14.3 Multiple handlers
Different throws in a try block may throw different exception types. Multiple handlers may exist, each handling a different type. The first matching handler executes; remaining handlers are skipped.

catch(...) is a catch-all handler that catches any type, which is useful when listed as the last handler.
